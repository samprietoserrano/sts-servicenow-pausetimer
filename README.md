# sts-servicenow-pausetimer_plugin

I wrote a JS script for the Violentmonkey automation Chrome-extention. 

Download link is here https://openuserjs.org/install/samxp/ServiceNow_Stop_Timer.user.js.

The script works for tickets within the ServiceNow platform of Stanford Student Tech Support team. The script automatically pauses a time that run within the ticket backend, since our team does not want to use the timer metrics and does not want to wrongly conflate the performance metrics it results in.
