# sts-servicenow-pausetimer_plugin

I wrote a JS script for the Violentmonkey automation Chrome-extention.

The script works for tickets within the ServiceNow platform of Stanford Student Tech Support team. The script automatically pauses a timer that runs within the ticket backend, given that our specific team does not want to use the timer metrics and does not want to wrongly conflate our performance metrics with the data it results in.
